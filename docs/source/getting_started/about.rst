About
================

This project consist of three main python libraries

pyECSS
---------------------
The pyECSS library is the core of the Elements project. It implements the **Entities**, **Components** and **Systems**, introduces a scenegraph data structure
to sustain the elements in a common scene and proposes a **Geometric Algebra** transformation engine.


pyGLV
---------------------
The pyGLV library introduces graphical examples using ECS in a scenegraph. With many examples, it shows how you can use the pyECSS with OpenGL to render
scenes that utilize the powerful ECS in a scenegraph.


pyEEL
---------------------
The pyEEL library pushes the state of the art in neural networks, machine learning and deep learning. It presents examples on how users can utilize the ECS in a scenegraph for deep learing.
